# 🧠 Veracity Vigilance: Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This machine learning project detects fake news using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and TF-IDF vectorization. It analyzes news articles and predicts whether they are real or fake with a confidence score. The project is built in Google Colab with an interactive, beginner-friendly workflow.

## 🚀 Features
- Text cleaning and preprocessing using NLTK
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Logistic Regression for classification
- Accuracy and performance metrics
- Visualized confidence scores using bar charts
- Custom input text support

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3 (Google Colab)
- Libraries: pandas, sklearn, nltk, seaborn, matplotlib
- Notebook-based workflow
- GitHub for version control

## 📊 Project Status
- ✅ Idea & Planning – Completed
- ✅ Data Collection – Completed (via Kaggle)
- ✅ Preprocessing & Cleaning – Completed
- ✅ Model Training – Completed
- ✅ Evaluation & Testing – Completed
- ✅ Visual Output – Completed
- 🔄 Streamlit App – Planned
